# JAXB2 Maven Plugin #

Welcome to the `org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2:jaxb2-maven-plugin`, the most advanced and feature-full Maven plugin for XML Schema compilation.

Starting with version 0.15.0 the plugin has been renamed from maven-jaxb2-plugin to jaxb2-maven-plugin to fulfill maven 3 naming schema. 

This Maven plugin wraps and enhances the [JAXB](https://jaxb.java.net/) [Schema Compiler (XJC)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/xjc.html) and allows
compiling XML Schemas (as well as WSDL, DTDs, RELAX NG) into Java classes in Maven builds.

> If you are interested in the Mojohaus JAXB2 Maven Plugin (`org.codehaus.mojo:jaxb2-maven-plugin`),
